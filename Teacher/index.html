			<div class="sidebar" style="float: left">This web-app is an enormous vault of useful information that are uploaded & maintained by authentication of users themselves. Users are the ones to control the access of shared files. The uploaded files can also be collaborated with "courses" created by teachers.</div>
			<div class="icon archives" style="float:right"></div>

			<div class="clr"></div>
			
			<div class="icon server" style="float:left"></div>
			<div class="sidebar" style="float: right">Despite having the interest of establishing a file sharing media, we don't have our own cloud storage. The issue is solved because of the existence of other cloud storage projects. The basis of sharing info in this web-app is embedding links to various files uploaded in different cloud servers. </div>
			
			<div class="clr"></div>
			
			<div class="sidebar" style="float: left">Due to this, the field of sharing files becomes wider. In addition, access to permitted personal files stored in various cloud drives like Google Drive, MEGA, Dropbox, Youtube, etc is possible. All that's needed is the delivery of a sharable  link.</div>
			<div class="icon transfer" style="float:right"></div>

			<div class="clr"></div>
			
			<div class="icon search" style="float:left"></div>
			<div class="sidebar" style="float: right">All the cloud storages allow searching of files, but that operation is limited within users' own files only. Our website has an improved search option that can find links shared by all the users. The operation is done by preference of keywords. In the search results, only the links that are marked as visible will be displayed.</div>
			
			<div class="clr"></div>

			<div class="sidebar" style="float: left">Whether others can access a file or not, however, is completely within the hands of the uploader. Users can select "privacy" of sharing in order to limit access to specific categories of users. That means, when a user shares a link, other file links that the user isn't willing to share will not be revealed to the commoners.</div>
			<div class="icon privacy" style="float:right"></div>

			<div class="icon stationery" style="float:left"></div>
			<div class="sidebar" style="float: right">As a learning platform, depending on the contents of uploaded materials, this web-app can provide with all sorts of information including books & study notes, tutorial videos, statistics & data of research atricles, presentation slides, advisory blogs, etc.</div>
			
			<div class="clr"></div>

			<div class="sidebar" style="float: left">This website is not just limited within sharing study materials. Tabulations of marks/evaluation of class performances can be provided to the students in the same method of file sharing. Then again, question of privacy appears. Don't be worried. The sharing privacy can prevent data from falling into wrong hands.

			<div class="icon goal" style="float:left"></div>
			<div class="sidebar" style="float: right">The ultimate goal of this project is easier sharing of research materials & educational info, as well as introducing a new media of learning. Permission to accessing personal files can always offer a chance of learning something that popular search engines fail to provide.</div>
